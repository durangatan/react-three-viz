# React-Three-Viz.com

This repository contains the source code and infrastructure for [react-three-viz.com](react-three-viz.com).

## Tools

Here's a list of the tools this project uses. I didn't have a hand in making any of them but I think they are all awesome. Go buy them all coffees.

- React-Three-Viz is an [NX](nx.dev) monorepo.
- The visualization is powered by [react-three-fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber), a React renderer for Three.js.
- The audio playback and analysis is powered by the built-in Web Audio API!

## Acknowledgements

- The background music is "Pyre" by Joe Duran & Tom Buckley. If you dig it, throw us a few bucks on [bandcamp](duruckley.bandcamp.com).
- The Three.js visualizer code was heavily-inspired by [this Medium article by Prakhar Bhardwaj](https://medium.com/@mag_ops/music-visualiser-with-three-js-web-audio-api-b30175e7b5ba).
